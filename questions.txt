Questions for The Game of Life program

a. What are the dimensions of the grid?
The dimensions are 25 rows by 70 columns globally

b. With what sort of data structure is the game's grid represented?

It's a 2D global array

c. What does the function executeChoice() do?

It is a function that takes an integer from the user and depending on the integer inputted uses the switch branching structure to perform the different actions presented in the menu. Within each case there are the smaller functions that are in charge of either simulating the game, reading a file, saving a file, generating a random environment, changing the frame rate, or exiting the program. 

d. What functions do you apparently need to implement?

I need to initialize the global grid. I need to write the function drawGrid, the openFile function, the saveFile function, the step function, and finally the randomizeGrid function. 

e. What command line argument(s) do(es) the program take?  What do(es) it (or they) do? 

This program takes either 0, 1 or 2 arguments depending on the user inputs. However within each if branch the function is either checking to see if the user enter a 't' to enter into the program or if it was not explicitly entered places the 't' character into argv[0] position to execute the clear () function, the draw grid function, and the draw Menu function.
